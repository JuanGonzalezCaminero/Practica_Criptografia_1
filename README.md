# ECC Codes
Provides methods for adding and multiplying elements of finite fields in Z2, encoding elements from finite fields, 
given a transformation matrix and irreducible polynomial, correcting errors that may appear in encoded data, and
decoding the data to it's original form.

Written for a university assignment, mainly as a way to improve my understanding of Error Correcting Codes.
